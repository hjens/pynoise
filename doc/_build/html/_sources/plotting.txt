Visualizing results
===================

You may of course use the visualization software of your choice to plot the results, but :mod:`pynoise` also includes some simple routines for some of the most common tasks. These routines all rely on :mod:`matplotlib` for the plotting. 

.. note::
    If you are running these commands from a Python shell, you may also need to run the :mod:`matplotlib` command :func:`show` to actually show the plots. This depends on your local setup.

.. autofunction:: pynoise.plot_visibility_slice
.. autofunction:: pynoise.plot_psf
.. autofunction:: pynoise.plot_image_slice
.. autofunction:: pynoise.plot_uv_coverage
.. autofunction:: plot_uv_coverage_radial
