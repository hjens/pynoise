===================================

About pynoise
-------------
:mod:`pynoise` is a simple Python module for calculating thermal noise of a radio interferometer, specifically suited for high-redshift 21 cm observations. It is based on code written by Kanan Datta. The module is made to be used either as part of a Python script, or interactively from the Python shell.

It can generate realistic noise in both image and visibility space, and calculate noise power spectra.

Installation
------------
Download from `GitHub <https://github.com/hjens/pynoise>`_ and make sure the directory is in your PYTHONPATH. You must have :mod:`numpy` and :mod:`scipy` installed. For the built-in plotting routines, :mod:`matplotlib` is required.
